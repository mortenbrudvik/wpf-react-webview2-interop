### Key Points
- Research suggests Microsoft WebView2 enables communication between WPF apps and hosted React web apps via messaging, JavaScript execution, and object exposure.
- It seems likely that key methods include `PostWebMessageAsString/AsJson` for WPF to React, and `window.chrome.webview.postMessage` for React to WPF.
- The evidence leans toward using `ExecuteScriptAsync` for running JavaScript from WPF and `AddHostObjectToScript` for exposing WPF objects to React.

### Direct Answer

Microsoft WebView2 offers robust ways for your WPF application to interact with a hosted React web app, making it ideal for hybrid desktop applications. Here's a breakdown:

#### Communication Methods
You can send messages from your WPF app to the React app using `CoreWebView2.PostWebMessageAsString` or `PostWebMessageAsJson`, which are simple and effective for passing data like text or JSON. Conversely, the React app can send messages back to WPF using `window.chrome.webview.postMessage`, and WPF can listen for these using the `WebMessageReceived` event. This bidirectional messaging is crucial for real-time updates, such as changing UI elements based on user actions.

#### Executing JavaScript
From WPF, you can run JavaScript in the React app using `ExecuteScriptAsync`. This is useful for triggering React functions or manipulating the DOM, like alerting users about security issues or updating displayed content dynamically.

#### Exposing Native Objects
You can also expose WPF objects to the React app using `AddHostObjectToScript`, allowing React to call methods on these objects. For example, this could enable React to interact with native camera functionality, enhancing the app's capabilities.

These features facilitate seamless data exchange, function calls, and UI updates, making it easier to build integrated hybrid applications. For practical examples, check out the sample code at [WebView2Samples on GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples).

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Microsoft WebView2 Interop Capabilities for WPF and React

Microsoft WebView2, a control based on the Chromium engine, enables developers to embed web content, including React applications, into native desktop applications like those built with Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). This integration is particularly valuable for creating hybrid applications that leverage both native and web technologies, offering a blend of performance and flexibility. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the interop capabilities, focusing on communication between WPF and React, based on recent documentation and community insights.

#### Background and Context
WebView2, introduced by Microsoft, allows embedding web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) into native apps, using Microsoft Edge as the rendering engine. For WPF developers, this means hosting a React web app within the desktop environment, enabling features like real-time data exchange and UI updates. The interop capabilities are critical for ensuring seamless interaction, addressing the challenge of bridging C# (WPF) and JavaScript (React).

#### Key Interop Capabilities
The interop capabilities of WebView2 can be categorized into messaging, scripting, and object exposure, each serving distinct purposes in facilitating communication:

1. **Simple Messaging**
    - **Description**: This capability allows bidirectional message passing between the WPF host and the React web content, using JSON or string formats. It is essential for updating UI elements, triggering actions, or sharing data.
    - **Methods**:
        - From WPF to React: Use `CoreWebView2.PostWebMessageAsString` or `PostWebMessageAsJson` to send messages. These methods are part of the `ICoreWebView2` interface, enabling the host to push data like configuration settings or user inputs to the React app.
        - From React to WPF: The React app can send messages using `window.chrome.webview.postMessage`, which WPF can receive by handling the `WebMessageReceived` event on `CoreWebView2`. This event triggers when the web content posts a message, allowing WPF to process it, such as updating the title bar or displaying alerts.
    - **Practical Use**: For example, changing text color in the React app based on WPF settings or updating the WPF UI with React-generated data, like form submissions.

2. **Executing JavaScript from WPF**
    - **Description**: This feature allows the WPF app to execute JavaScript code within the WebView2 context, interacting directly with the React app's DOM or executing functions. It is particularly useful for dynamic content manipulation or triggering React components.
    - **Method**: Use `ExecuteScriptAsync`, which runs JavaScript after the global object is created but before HTML document scripts, applicable to both top-level and child frames. This method returns results to the host, enabling feedback loops.
    - **Practical Use**: For instance, injecting a script to alert users about non-HTTPS navigation (`alert('... is not safe, try an https link')`) or updating the React app's state based on WPF logic, such as refreshing a React component's data.

3. **Exposing Native Objects to JavaScript**
    - **Description**: This capability allows the WPF app to expose native C# objects to the JavaScript environment, enabling React to call methods on these objects. It extends interop beyond messaging, facilitating complex interactions like accessing device features.
    - **Method**: Use `AddHostObjectToScript` to pass native objects, which can then be accessed via `window.chrome.webview.hostObjects.{name}` in JavaScript. This is useful for scenarios requiring native functionality, such as camera access or file system operations.
    - **Practical Use**: For example, exposing a camera object to React, allowing it to call methods like capturing images, enhancing the app's multimedia capabilities.

#### Practical Implementation Steps
To implement these interop capabilities in a WPF app hosting a React web app, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up WebView2 in WPF**:
    - Add the WebView2 control to your WPF project by including the namespace `xmlns:wv2="clr-namespace:Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Wpf;assembly=Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Wpf"` in XAML.
    - Install the WebView2 Runtime on the target machine, ensuring compatibility with the latest Microsoft Edge version. Use the NuGet package `Microsoft.Web.WebView2` for integration.

2. **Host the React App**:
    - Serve the React app locally or from a server, typically at a URL like `http://localhost:3000`. Navigate the WebView2 control to this URL using `webView.CoreWebView2.Navigate("http://localhost:3000")` after initializing with `EnsureCoreWebView2Async`.

3. **Establish Communication**:
    - **WPF to React**: Send messages using `CoreWebView2.PostWebMessageAsString` or `PostWebMessageAsJson`, for example, to trigger a React component update:
      ```csharp
      await webView.CoreWebView2.PostWebMessageAsJson("{\"action\":\"updateColor\",\"color\":\"blue\"}");
      ```
    - **React to WPF**: In React, listen for messages using `window.chrome.webview.addEventListener("message", (event) => { console.log(event.data); })`, and send messages using `window.chrome.webview.postMessage("Hello from React!")`. In WPF, handle incoming messages:
      ```csharp
      webView.CoreWebView2.WebMessageReceived += (sender, args) =>
      {
          string message = args.TryGetWebMessageAsString();
          MessageBox.Show(message);
      };
      ```

4. **Additional Interop**:
    - Use `ExecuteScriptAsync` for running JavaScript, such as:
      ```csharp
      await webView.CoreWebView2.ExecuteScriptAsync("alert('Non-HTTPS site detected');");
      ```
    - Expose WPF objects to React using `AddHostObjectToScript`, for example, to allow React to call a method:
      ```csharp
      webView.CoreWebView2.AddHostObjectToScript("MyObject", new MyWpfObject());
      ```
      In React, access it via `window.chrome.webview.hostObjects.MyObject.method()`.

#### Considerations and Best Practices
While the above methods are effective, consider the following for React with WebView2 in WPF:
- Ensure the React app is served via HTTP/HTTPS, as modern browsers (and thus WebView2) may restrict non-secure content.
- Handle initialization asynchronously using `EnsureCoreWebView2Async` to avoid null reference exceptions, especially in complex WPF assemblies.
- For security, validate messages to prevent injection attacks, particularly when exposing native objects.
- The Medium article suggests using `window.chrome.webview` API for communication, which is consistent with WebView2 documentation, but be aware that WinForms examples may need adaptation for WPF, such as handling UI thread synchronization.

#### Sample Resources and Community Insights
For practical implementation, refer to the following resources:
- The [WebView2Samples repository](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples) contains WPF samples like `WebView2WpfBrowser`, demonstrating general WebView2 usage, though not specifically React.
- The Stack Overflow discussion ([Communicate between JS and WPF through WebView2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71510211/how-to-communicate-between-js-and-wpf-through-webview2)) highlights two-way communication challenges, suggesting `PostWebMessageAsJson` and `window.chrome.webview.postMessage` as solutions, with additional tools like WebView2.DevTools.Dom for advanced DOM access.
